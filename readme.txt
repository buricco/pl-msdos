The initial upload of this tree was a radical reorganization of the sources to
MS-DOS 2.11 as originally uploaded in 2014, which I did in 2016, but left out
those parts which I could not build at the time, i.e., the kernel.

John Elliott provided the missing pieces on his website, and I combined that
with my own work.

Build EXE2BIN first and put it in the TOOLS folder; you'll need it.

(The other TOOLS are not part of the package.)
